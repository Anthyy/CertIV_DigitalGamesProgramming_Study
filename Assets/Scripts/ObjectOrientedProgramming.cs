// This script implements the challenge at the end of the 'Object Oriented Programming' video for the 'Master Unity Game Development - Ultimate Beginners Bootcamp' StackSkills course:

/* 1. Create a method called 'PrintGame'. This method will print in the console the type of game you want to make the most.
 * 2. Execute 'PrintGame' in the 'Start' method.
 * 3. Run game to see the result in the console.
 * 4. Create a public variable of type "string" called "myGameIdea".
 * 5. Go to the inspector and enter a value.
 * 6. Modify your "PrintGame" method to show the value of "myGameIdea" in the console.
